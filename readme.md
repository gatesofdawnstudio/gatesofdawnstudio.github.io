My name is Kiley Burkhart, and I operate a music recording and production studio called Gates of Dawn in Westerville, OH. I am passionate about helping independent artists bring their songs to life. I am open to working on all kinds of music. I specialize in the rock/pop world as a musician and multi-instrumentalist. I provide affordable project based rates and a relaxed environment with flexible scheduling and payment options.
